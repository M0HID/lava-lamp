This is a lava lamp that I created in Blender. It uses metaballs as the fluid inside the lamp so they appear to merge together when close together, allowing for a more realistic effect. The final render can be viewed in 'output.mp4', and the blend file can be found [here](https://github.com/M0HID/lava-lamp/blob/main/lavalamp.blend)
